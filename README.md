# NESPi_DIY

V 0.5

This is the DIY guide for NESPi by Daftmike - http://www.daftmike.com/2016/07/NESPi.html . This guide below is in no way endorsed by Daftmike.

Daftmike has been busy putting together his electronic kits and hasn't had time to create the DIY guide and schematic.

The schematic is not yet complete (missing front LED and RGB LED and others) I will be updating this.\
Any problems or ideas please post in the Issues section.

I will also post the BOM below once I have time.
